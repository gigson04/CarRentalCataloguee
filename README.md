# CarRentalCataloguee
In this project, we created a basic Car Rental Catalogue System designed to manage vehicle rentals efficiently. Our system implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and uses SQLite as the database to store and manage information.

We implemented a Dashboard Form that provides an overview of the system. In this form, we can view the available cars, check the users who have rented vehicles, and monitor the cars that have been returned.

We also developed a Vehicles Form, where users can choose which car they want to rent. This form allows us to add new cars, edit existing car details, refresh the DataGridView, and use a Rent button to proceed with renting a selected vehicle.

To complete the rental process, we created a Rent Form, which allows users to confirm the car they want to rent before finalizing the transaction.

Lastly, we implemented a User Form, where we can view the users who have rented cars. From this form, we can remove users once they return the cars they rented, ensuring that rental records remain updated.

Overall, this project demonstrates our understanding of CRUD operations, SQLite database integration, and form-based system design in developing a functional car rental management application.
